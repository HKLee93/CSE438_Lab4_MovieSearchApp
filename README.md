# # Fall 2018 :: CSE 438 Lab 4 - Movie Search App
It is a movie-searching app, which allows users to find information about movies. Data will be pulled from The Movie Databaseâ€™s (TMDb) API (http://www.themoviedb.org).

# # Build Environment
  - Xcode 9.4
  - Swift 4
  - iPhone 8

# # Features
  - Users can search for movies, and up to 20 movies are shown as a result.
  - Users can select a movie to view more details.
  - Users can add movies to and delete movies from the Favorites.
  - Users can use the search filter (language option and adult search option).
  - Users can see the trailer of the movies that are on the Favorites.

# # Design Choices
  - For UICollectionView cell image, I used w154 size, and for detailed view image, I used w500 size. When images are not possible to fetch, it will be empty.
  - An additional class is used to set shared variables between UITabBar views.
  - Once API call is done, fetched images are cached.
  - Trailers are shown using WKWebView.
